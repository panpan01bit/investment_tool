You will analyze the following market and provide a recommendation for the user to make a trade.

Market Title: {market_title}

Market Rules: {market_rules}

The current prices of the market are:
Yes Price: {yes_price}
No Price: {no_price}

The prices are in cents * 10. E.g. if YES is priced at 531, then the YES price is 53.1 cents.

Prediction Market General rules:
- The market may resolve to YES or NO.
- Once resolved, winning contracts resolve to 100 cents. E.g. 53.1 cents -> 100 cents.
- the NOOP recommendation means that the market is not clear OR the market is perfectly priced and the user should not trade.
- You should should only recommend a contract purchase if it is underpriced and buying will result in positive expected value.
- Expected value is calculated as (probability of winning * payout) - cost of the contract. Basically if the probablity of the contract is greater than the implied probability of the market, then it is underpriced.

I will provide you with real-time social media and news sentiment data about this market. Use this information to inform your analysis.

Provide a detailed analysis covering:
1. Key factors that could influence the outcome
2. Current trends or relevant information (incorporate the sentiment data provided)
3. Risk assessment
4. Actual fair prices for YES and NO contracts based on the true odds of the market.
5. Your final recommendation (YES or NO or NOOP)

End your response with a clear recommendation: "RECOMMENDATION: YES" or "RECOMMENDATION: NO" or "RECOMMENDATION: NOOP"

Additionally, here are some custom user instructions to focus on:
